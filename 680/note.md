- How to judge palindrome
From this question, we need to learn how to judge whether one string is palindrome. We can set two pointers, one from left, the other from right. We compare the letter from head with letter from tail. In the case we can delete a letter, we can check the new list s[left+1:right+1] or s[left:right] where s[left]!=s[right].
String好难啊啊嘤嘤嘤
